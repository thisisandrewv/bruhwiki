I'm getting so fucking tired of working a whole weekend to figure out my dotfiles and then abandoning them for a year. The whole point is these fucks are supposed to make it easier to reimage your device and not have to worry about settings being adjusted and apps being installed...

Anyway, There are a few things I want my dotfiles to do for me:

* I need them to save my config for my device. This includes default browser, system accent color, apps on the dock, dock size and behavior, folder creation in finder, etc.
* Install all of the apps I use the most including ones on the App Store, ones with a cask, and ones with neither.
* Save configs for things such as raycast, Arc browser, etc.

All this to say, I will update this file as time goes on to reflect how to achieve the things I just listed using dotfiles.

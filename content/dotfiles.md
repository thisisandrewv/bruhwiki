# Good Shit!
If you're reading this it means your initial setup completed successfully. There are just a few more things you'll need to do to finish setting up your device.
### Browser Extensions
Unfortunately, as of the writing of this page, [Arc Browser](arc.net) does not sync your extensions to your account. What this means is that you'll have to reinstall each extension individually. Here are the links to each extension:

* [uBlock Origin](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm)
* [Youtube Auto HD + FPS](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/fcphghnknhkimeagdglkljinmpbagone)
* [Umami](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/umami/ijlhanbdodlfgklfafdmlnfodbndbkph)
* [The Marvellous Suspender](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/the-marvellous-suspender/noogafoofpebimajpfpamcfhoaifemoa)
* [Sponsorblock](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/sponsorblock-for-youtube/mnjggcdmjocbbbhaepdhchncahnbgone)
* [Save to Pocket](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/save-to-pocket/niloccemoadcdkdjlinkgdfekeahmflj)
* [Youtube Dislike](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/return-youtube-dislike/gebbhagfogifgggkldgodflihgfeippi)
* [Notion Web Clipper](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/notion-web-clipper/knheggckgoiihginacbkhaalnibhilkk)
* [1password](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/1password-%E2%80%93-password-mana/aeblfdkhhhdcdjpifhhbdiojplfjncoa)
* [BetterTTV](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/betterttv/ajopnjidmegmdimjlfnijceegpefgped?pli=1)

### Cookies Settings
Again, since Arc doesn't sync any of this currently you'll need to manually make the following changes:

Go to [Site Data](arc://settings/content/siteData) on Arc and make the following changes:

* Default behavior: Delete data sites have saved to your device when you close all windows

* Allowed to save data on your device:
  
	1password.com
	amazon.com
	gmail.com
	accounts.google.com
	[*.]messages.google.com
	libbyapp.com
	chat.openai.com
	patreon.com
	youtube.com
	bigbox.local
	[*.]parce.mov
	[*.]notion.so
	[*.]plex.tv
	twitch.tv


Manually organize your launchpad page with the following folders:

Ô£ø, Ô£øÔ£ø, Ô£øÔ£øÔ£ø - here you will store all of your presintalled mac apps

üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª - here you will store all of your admin apps / coding apps

üì∑ - photography related apps

üóø - all other apps you don't regularly use
